After the introduction of the weapon Taipan-FR4 into the video game Destiny 2, it quickly became realized that it had two interesting attributes, or perks, that quickly sprang it to a community favorite, those being Veist Stinger, which has a 10% chance on any damage from any bullet to fully reload the gun from reserves, or the ammunition that one has in their inventory, and Triple Tap, which allows one to gain an extra bullet to their magazine not from oneâ€™s inventory after three quick precision shots. Hence, because the weapon can have 3 different magazine sizes of 5, 6 or 7, we hypnotized that having the maximum number of shots in the magazine, 7, would give a person the best chance to proc, a term meaning that random chance occurred, Veist Stinger. In order to test this, we created a discrete stochastic model that would simulate each magazine size and their ability to proc Veist Stinger in tangent to Triple Tap over the course of 100,000 simulation to see if they were significantly different from one another by using T-Tests. First, we assumed perfect accuracy and then compared that to 85% accuracy. We found that not only was 7 the best magazine size to use for this random chance regardless of accuracy, but also that any increase in the magazine size was significantly different from the previous, meaning that not only is 7 the best for proc chance, but any increase to magazine size is a benefit in context to the chance for Veist Stinger to occur.
