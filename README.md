# Destiny2_Simulation
Adam and I created a discrete stochastic model to model the effects of magazine size, Veist Stinger, and Tripple Tap in Destiny 2. After breaking down the problem and deconstructing gameplay footage into steps, I coded up a Python script to run 100,000 simulations to test how these perks interact. We created two experiments one with perfect accruacy and one with 85% accuracy. We found that regardless of the accruacy, having a magazine size of 7 was the most optimal.
